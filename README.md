# React Design Patterns and Best Practices
This is the code repository for [React Design Patterns and Best Practices](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/react-design-patterns-and-best-practices?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786464538), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Taking a complete journey through the most valuable design patterns in React, this book demonstrates how to apply design patterns and best practices in real-life situations, whether that’s for new or already existing projects. It will help you to make your applications more flexible, perform better, and easier to maintain – giving your workflow a huge boost when it comes to speed without reducing quality.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter03.
Also, the code for Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 is not present as these chapters contains basic examples to start with.


The code will look like the following:
```
const toLowerCase = input => {
const output = []
for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
output.push(input[i].toLowerCase())
}
return output
}
```

We will need a computer with a terminal, a node.js/npm environment, and a browser.
